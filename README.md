# 🚀 Issue Navigator for Open Source Repos

## 📌 Business Problem

Open-source projects are massive, with thousands of files and issues.
For new contributors, **the biggest challenge is not solving the issue itself but figuring out where to start.**

This project solves that by building an **Agentic System** that:

* Takes a **GitHub repo link** and an **issue link**.
* Fetches issue content via the **GitHub API**.
* Uses the repo knowledge base from **DigitalOcean** to provide **step-by-step actionable tasks** for resolving the issue.

In short:
👉 *“Don’t just show me the issue, show me where to start.”*

## 🏗️ Proposed Architecture

We envision a **two-agent system**:

1. **Issue Scraper Agent**

   * Input: GitHub issue URL
   * Function: Fetch issue details (title, description, comments, labels, linked PRs, etc.) using the **GitHub API**
   * Output: Structured issue context

2. **Issue Triage Agent**

   * Input: Issue context + Repo knowledge base (from **DigitalOcean**)
   * Function: Generate **step-by-step developer tasks** to start resolving the issue
   * Output: Beginner-friendly starting points

## ⚡ Current Architecture

The system is functional but still evolving:

1. **Knowledge Base**

   * Limited subset of repo data fetched from **DigitalOcean**.

2. **Scraping**

   * Currently, issues are fetched directly via the **GitHub API** rather than through a dedicated agent.

3. **Triage**

   * The Issue Triage Agent runs on partial repo knowledge + scraped issue text.
   * Produces step-by-step dev tasks, but full automation is still in progress.

## ✅ Roadmap

* [ ] Build a dedicated **Issue Scraper Agent**
* [ ] Expand **Repo Knowledge Base** to cover the entire repo
* [ ] Enhance **Issue Triage Agent** with more detailed steps
* [ ] Add **GitHub Actions integration** to auto-comment triage steps on issues
* [ ] Support **multi-issue triaging** and prioritization

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python
* **APIs**: GitHub API, DigitalOcean API
* **Agents**: Custom agent framework
* **Knowledge Base**: DigitalOcean-hosted repo knowledge
* **Deployment/Future**: GitHub Actions integration
